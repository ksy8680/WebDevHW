# **SPICY TTEOKBOKKI RECIPE**

1. Make tteokbokki sauce: Mix the gochujang, Korean red pepper flakes, sugar, soy sauce, and garlic in a small bowl. Set it aside.
2. Add rice cakes and fish cakes: Add the water or anchovy stock to a large pan and bring to a boil. Add the tteokbokki sauce, rice cakes, fish cakes, and optional vegetables.
3. Cook over medium heat until the rice cakes are soft and the sauce thickens to your liking. About 5 to 7 minutes. Add more stock/water if desired.
4. Taste and adjust to your liking. Add more sugar or soy sauce if desired. Top with sesame oil, scallions, and sesame seeds.

*If using, add the pre-cooked noodles, boiled eggs, or top with shredded cheese at this time. Enjoy!*
